	problem statement:partition array it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:
		              Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
                      left and right are non-empty.
                      left has the smallest possible size.
    Approach:store the no at index 0 in maxi and inititialize res as 0. now iterate throught the array 
    if no is less than  maxi update res with current index otherwise check wheather their exist some 
    no after that index which is strictly less than maxi if exist update maxi to new max value repeadt this
    finally return res+1 as ans.
